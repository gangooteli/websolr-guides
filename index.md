## Partners

Websolr is integrated with both Heroku and EngineYard to provide their customers with hosted Solr search. If you are a user of these services, then the following articles may be relevant to your interests:

* [Heroku users](/guides/partners/heroku/)
* [EngineYard users](/guides/partners/engineyard/)


## Learning more about Solr

Solr is a mature technology with a broad user base and active developer community. If you're coming to Solr for the first time, the amount of information can be a bit overwhelming. The following articles should contain all you need to understand the basics:

* [Solr Features](/guides/solr/solr-features.html)
* [Solr Resources](/guides/solr/)


## Solr Client Tutorials

Solr is simply a server based on the [Lucene project](http://lucene.apache.org/core/). As such, you will need a client to act as a middleman to send and receive data between your application or website and your websolr index. The following articles give details for setting up, configuring and troubleshooting some of the more popular clients in use:

* [Client configuration overview](guides/clients/solr-client-configuration-overview.html)
* [Drupal 7 Apachesolr module](guides/drupal/drupal7-apachesolr.html)
* [Drupal 7 Search API Solr Module](guides/drupal/drupal7-searchapisolr.html)
* [Sunspot](/guides/rails/sunspot-quick-start.html)
* [Wordpress](guides/wordpress/)


## General Tutorials

There is a lot to learn with Solr, and even knowledgeable developers can sometimes find themselves at a loss to understand why their search functions are not working as intended. These articles cover such topics:

* [Working with autocomplete](guides/autocomplete/)
* [What are "grams"?](/guides/solr/what-are-grams.html)
* [Why you should avoid wildcards in searches](/guides/solr/dont-use-wildcards.html)
* [Setting up Sunspot for local development](/guides/rails/setting-up-sunspot-for-local-development.html)
